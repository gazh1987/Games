flappyBird
==========
   - Not the full game. Just the bird and a few clouds.
   - version 1.2: full game implemented, added towers, score, and reset game method. 
   - version 1.3: slight change. Clouds now move slower than the pipes in the background. Gives the illusion they are          further away in the distance.
